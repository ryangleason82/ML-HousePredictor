# ML-HousePredictor
Machine Learning algorithm to determine how much a house will cost based on the houses in its area

## Important concepts learned:

- K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
  - "Birds of a feather flock together"
- Features vs Labels
  - Independent vs dependent variables
  - Point of this is to find a correlation between the two
  - The key is to find an algorithm that helps you accomplish this
- Classification vs Regression
  - classification: when the value of our labels belong to a _discrete_ set
  - regression: when the value of our labels belong to a _continuous_ set
- Test vs Training sets of data
  - do this in order to find an ideal k value
  - record a bunch of data points, split into training/test
  - for each 'test' record, run knn using the training data
  - does the result of knn equal test?
- Feature Normalization
  - Difference between .51 and .54 is much smaller than 510 and 540 (look on a graph)
  - So we must normalize them by putting them between 0 and 1
- Feature selections
  - choosing to leave some features out for better results
- Common data structures for ML (array of arrays)

## Why do we need Tensorflow?

- Lodash is what we used for this but it has its pros and cons
  - Pros:
    - Methods for just about everything we need
    - Excellent API design (chain, makes it easy)
    - Can use in any JS project
  - Cons:
    - Extremely slow (relatively)
    - Not 'numbers' focused. We need something numbers focused because our data is going to be huge
    - Some number related things are awkward like getting a column of values
- Tensorflow JS
  - Pros:
    - Similar API to Lodash
    - Extremely fast for number calculations
    - Has a 'low level' linear algebra API + higher level API for ML
    - Similar API to numpy which is a popular Python numerical lib
  - Cons:
    - Still in active development
